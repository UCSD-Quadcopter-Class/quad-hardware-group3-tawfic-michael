filter caps in motor controller sohuld 0.1uF
MOS fet symbol should be a transistor symbol.  Yours matches the package, but that doesn't make for an easy-to-read schematic.

VCC should be nameed VBAT

Your breakout header has two connection to GND and none to BAT_GND

THe filter cap on the input of the voltage regulator should be connected to BAT_GND

Several pins that need to be connected on the IMU are not.  Read the data sheet section about what each pins does.

The GND symblos should always point downward.  

Your custom LEDs are going to burn out without a resistor.

why 5.1KOhm for pull ups on SDA/SCL?

There's a label for PWM-PB5 near your uController, but I don't see where the net is.

The TX and RX lines are backwards on your FTDI and serial ports.

CLKI and TST on your microcontroller need to be grounded.

you are using the wrong capacitors in your motor drivers.  Use the ones from prebuilt.  Same goes for the resistors.

you have some badly-misplaced net labels. For instance, the C3 seems to be attached 3V, but it is not.  For a simila reason, your microcontroller is not connected to power.
