You've got long wires on VBAT and BAT_GND.  Come see me during class for how to fix.

ok
	
Antenna

Your antena is surrounded by ground.  It shuold stick out from ground cage.


Oscillator

Your oscillator layout needs to match what's the red board.

decoupling

The decoupling caps for the IMU and icrocontroller need to be closer to the ICs.  Same goes for the caps between the IMU and ground.

Voltage regulator

ok

Jumper

Your jumper is under one of your props.  It's going to be hard to turn off your quad.

Reset button

You have no reset button.

Misc

The pads on your mosfet are too small.  See page 6 of the datasheet. 

Get rid of the box around your board.
