Power

You've got long wires on VBAT and BAT_GND.  Come see me during class for how to fix.

DRC

Your battery conflicts with a bunch of other parts.  If you want, you can put it on the bottom.


Motor holders

ok.

Pours

ok
	
Antenna

Your antena is surrounded by ground.  It shuold stick out from ground cage.


Oscillator

Your oscillator layout needs to match what's the red board.

decoupling

The decoupling caps for the IMU and icrocontroller need to be closer to the ICs.  Same goes for the caps between the IMU and ground.

Voltage regulator

ok

Jumper

Your jumper is under one of your props.  It's going to be hard to turn off your quad.

Reset button

You have no reset button.

Misc

The pads on your mosfet are too small.  See page 6 of the datasheet. 

Get rid of the box around your board. 

commit f9c4a9ab122ed923742055bcc741036df990c7e2

Cap 28 should connect to GND instead of BATGND.

There should be no vias on the wires between your oscilator and the microcontroller.

You are using the wrong diodes in yoru motor controller.  See my recent posting on piazza.

Pads on mosfets too small. see piazza.

you have a trace under your antenna.

The wires to your antenna driver could be more symetrical.
